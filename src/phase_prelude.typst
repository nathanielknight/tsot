= Instructions

In this phase you'll introduce the characters, their mission, and the setting.

- Make moves from your playbook or from this sheet
- Once you've made a move check it off; you can't make it again
- Answer the questions in each move with a beat in the film. This can be a few shots, a montage or a whole scene.
- You can always ask other players for input, ask that their character be in your scene, or ask them to play an extra character.
- Make moves until there are none left or until it makes sense to move to the Encounter Phase
