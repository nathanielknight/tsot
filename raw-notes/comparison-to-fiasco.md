I feel like this game wants to share some DNA with Fiasco. The players are:

* picking things from lists,
* thinking filmicly,
* making bad things happen to their characters,
* collaborating with others to figure out how a scene should go

On the other hand, it's also quite different: 

* Fiasco is much more direct about the little atoms of story and theme that
  you get
* Fiasco is much more open-ended
* Fiasco is shorter (4 scenes per person!)
