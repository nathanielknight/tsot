# Play to find out...

- What happens?

- Who are these characters?
- Why are they here?
- What's waiting for them?
- Why are they _really_ here?

# Themes

- Powerful people harm others to advance their own interests
- The universe is vast and hostile, 

# What are the player experience goals?

Broadly speaking, to create an experience where players: 

- Portray a hostile world where authority cares little and the universe cares less.  
- Portray callous organizations with no patience, scruples, or foresight 
- Portray normal people in over their heads; hubristic people brought low by their own arrogance 
- Have the game force horror movie stuff to happen AND for the players to choose it
