# Play to find out...

- What happens?

- Who are these characters?
- Why are they here?
- What's waiting for them?
- Why are they _really_ here?

# Themes

- Powerful people harm others to advance their own interests
- The universe is vast and hostile
- The visual language of movies is cool and it's fun to play with it when you don't need an $x0,000,000 budget


# What are the player experience goals?

Broadly speaking, to create an experience where players: 

- Portray a hostile world where authority cares little and the universe cares less.  
- Portray callous organizations with no patience, scruples, or foresight 
- Portray normal people in over their heads; hubristic people brought low by their own arrogance 
- Have the game force horror movie stuff to happen AND for the players to choose it 


# Components

These are the things that TSOT is about; try to express them in every rule and move.

- expression
  - roleplay
  - film stuff (appreciation, description, knowledge of sets, fx, costumes, music, acting, shot composition)
  - telling a cool story that's like those movies you're fond of
- powers beyond the characters, human power, human understanding
- game! (chance, tensions, decisions and tradeoffs)
- anticipation and irony
  - foreshadowing and foreknowledge
  - punchable faces
  - beginning with the end in mind
- catharsis
  - comeuppance and just desserts
  - paying off foreshadowing

These are the things TSOT isn't about; avoid the temptation of including them because other games do:

- simulation
- dread
- bleed

# Pacing

If we're looking for a 1-2 hour play time, each player will get 5-8 moves.

- Intro: 2 moves
- Encounter: 2-4 moves
- Struggle: 1-3 moves
