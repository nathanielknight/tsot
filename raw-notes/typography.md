I want to base the typography for this game on the
[Apollo Lunar Module Documentation](https://www.nasa.gov/history/alsj/alsj-LMdocs.html)

What that means is:

- A geometric, drafting-style (e.g. a routed font, national parks font, etc.)
- A serif font with a high x-height, tiny descenders, fairly even strokes, and little detail for the body text
  (like the body text in [this document](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/static/history/alsj/LM10HandbookVol1.pdf))

Examples of the header font would be:

- [Routed Gothic Font](https://webonastick.com/fonts/routed-gothic/)
- [National Park Typeface](https://nationalparktypeface.com/)


Body font candidates are:

- [Vollkorn](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Vollkorn?stroke=Serif&preview.text=Jackdaws%20love%20my%20big%20sphinx%20of%20quartz) (note: has small caps!)
- [IBM Plex Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Serif)
