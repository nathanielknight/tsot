I want to base the typography for this game on the
[Apollo Lunar Module Documentation](https://www.nasa.gov/history/alsj/alsj-LMdocs.html)

What that means is:

- A geometric, drafting-style (e.g. a routed font, national parks font, etc.)
- A serif font with a high x-height, tiny descenders, fairly even strokes, and little detail for the body text
  (like the body text in [this document](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/static/history/alsj/LM10HandbookVol1.pdf))

The fonts I chose are

- [National Park Typeface](https://nationalparktypeface.com/)
  for headers, and
- [Vollkorn](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Vollkorn?stroke=Serif&preview.text=Jackdaws%20love%20my%20big%20sphinx%20of%20quartz) (note: has small caps!)
  for the body text.

  I struggled to find a body font that had the right proportions that didn't have fine details. Many old style fonts have delicate serifs, stroke variation, or little flourishes that would look very strange in the kind of cheaply printed technical manual I'm trying to emulate. In the end, Vollkorn has the right proportions and its thick, even strokes emulate smudgy printed letters well enough.
